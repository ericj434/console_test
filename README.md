# References used for the calculations and pokemon
[Pokemon Database](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex) --> used to get moves, move types, some math, and pokemon data  

[Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Damage) --> most of my calculations came from here  

[Ansii Art Generator](https://www.asciiart.eu/text-to-ascii-art) --> generates cool art using keyboard letters  

[Pokemon db forums](https://pokemondb.net/pokebase/25985/how-much-is-a-stage) --> this particular thread helped us with doing defense decreasing and stuff  


# What is this
This is a ripoff of generation 1 pokemon with only level one enemies and a cap level of 20 on the pokemons the pokemons only have a max level of 20.  
The blue spot should heal you and the red spot should restore all your pp used.  
Everything here is a copy of pokemon mechanics, just really poorly done due to time constraints.
